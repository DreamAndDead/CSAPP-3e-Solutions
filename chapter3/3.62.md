3.62

```c
!INCLUDE "./code/3.62.c"
```

Note that in the end, the question also states that "(The C code) contained one case that fell through to another - try to reconstruct this". Obviously, the given assembly code does not match this description, since each of its labels have a `ret` instruction. However, if possible, the block for `MODE_D` would fall through to `MODE_E` as follows:

```c
case MODE_D:
  *p1 = *p2;
case MODE_E:
  result = 27;
  break;
```
