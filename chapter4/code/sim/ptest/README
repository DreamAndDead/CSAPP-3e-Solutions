This directory contains Perl scripts that provide comprehensive
regression testing of the different Y86-64 simulators.  There are four
basic test types, implemented as four different scripts:

	optest.pl:	Tests each individual instruction type
	jtest.pl:	Tests all of the jump types under different conditions
	ctest.pl:	Tests different pipeline control combinations
	htest.pl:	Tests many different hazard possibilities
			This involves running 864+ tests, so it takes a while.

Each of the tests has the following optional arguments:
	-s simfile	Use simfile as simulator (default ../pipe/psim).
	-i		Test the iaddq instruction

You can use make to run all four test programs.  Options to make include:

	SIM=simfile
	TFLAGS=<any flags you want to give to the testing scripts>

For example, you could say:
	make SIM=../pipe/psim TFLAGS=-i
to test the pipeline simulator including the iaddq instruction.  (Note that
this test will fail for the default implementation of pipe, since it does
not implement the iaddq instruction.)

When the test program detects an erroneous simulation, it leaves the
.ys file in the directory (ordinarily it deletes the test code it
generates).  You can then run a simulator (the GUI version is
especially helpful here) on one of these failing cases.  Suppose the
failing test is in file bad-test.ys.  Then you can execute "make
bad-test.yo" to create the object code, and simulate it with one of
the simulators.

Note that the standard test code only detects functional bugs, where the
processor simulation produces different results than would be
predicted by simulating at the ISA level.
