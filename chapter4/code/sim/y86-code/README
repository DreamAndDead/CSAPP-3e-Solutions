This directory contains examples of Y86-64 assembly code programs
(extension `.ys') used in Chapter 4 of CS:APP3e.

Given an assembly code file "file.ys", you can assemble it with the
command "make file.yo".  The resulting file is in the "object code"
format described in the book.

You can assemble and simulate all the test programs in this directory.
First, you need to make the different simulators in the pipe (psim)
and seq (ssim and ssim+) directories.  Then use the following
commands:

PIPE: make testpsim
SEQ: make testssim
SEQ+: make testssim+

Each of these commands will cause a number of programs to be assembled
and simulated.  Lots of things will scroll by, but you should see the message
"ISA Check Succeeds" for each of the programs tested.
