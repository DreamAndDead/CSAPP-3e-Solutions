### N = 64

sizeof(array_t) == 64 * 64 == 4096 == 4*C


    memory-cache graph

    memory address start from 0 and end to 4096*4.

    cell size is 16B. number(0-255) in cell means cache block number that the cell
    will be cached.

A. sumA

    sum += a[i][j];

read memory address order:

0, 4, 8, 12, ....., 4096*4-4

read cache order:

0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1,.....255, 255, 255, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0,.....255, 255, 255,
255

first cache read miss, next 3 time read hit.

miss rate: 25%

B. sumB

    sum += a[j][i];


read memory address order:

0, 64*4, 64*4*2, .... 64*4*63, 4, 64*4+4, 64*4*2+4, .... 4096*4-4

read cache order:

0, 16, 32, 48, ... 240,(4 times) 1, 17, 33, ... 241,(4 times)
15, 31, 47, ... 255(4 times)

let's see first read loop:

read cache order loop 4 times

0, 16, 32, 48, ... 240,(4 times)

first loop all miss, next 3 loop all hit

so miss rate is 25%.

C. sumC

    for (i = 0; i < N; i+=2)
      for (j = 0; j < N; j+=2)
        sum += (a[j][i] + a[j][i+1] + a[j+1][i] + a[j+1][i+1]);

easy to see that read a[j][i+1] and a[j+1][i+1] always hit

same like

    for (i = 0; i < N; i+=2)
      for (j = 0; j < N; j+=2)
        sum += (a[j][i] + a[j+1][i]);

same like

    for (i = 0; i < N; i+=2)
      for (j = 0; j < N; j++)
        sum += a[j][i];

total read count = 64*64

because of i+=2,

read cache order only loop 2 times

0, 16, 32, 48, ... 240,(2 times)

so miss rate is 50%

totol read miss count = 64/2 * 64 * 50% = 64*64/4

so miss rate is still 25%.

### N = 60

A. sumA

    sum += a[i][j];

read memory by step 1

miss rate 25%

B. sumB

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
      for (j = 0; j < N; j++)
        sum += a[j][i];

it's interesting.

let's see first inner loop a[0][0] -> a[59][0]

read memory address order:

0, 60*4, 60*4*2, .... 60*4*59

read cache order:

0, 15, 30, ...., 225, (17 numbers)
255, 14, 29, ....., 224, (17 numbers)
254, 13, 28, ....., 223, (17 numbers)
253, 12, 27, 42, 57, 72, 87, 102, 117 (9 numbers)

all read miss and store into different blocks

next 3 loops: a[0][1] -> a[59][1], a[0][2] -> a[59][2], a[0][3] -> a[59][3]

all hit

althrough N is smaller and not power of 2, miss rate is still 25%

C. sumC

same as miss rate when N = 64

25%
